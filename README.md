# first personal project in C

goal: i intend to create a fight simulator between two characters that the user can choose the name and HP (health points) for

purpose: to understand C better and to get out of tutorial hell (coding this without any tutorials or guides)

checkpoints:
- [ ] ask the user to name the two characters via the console
- [ ] ask the user to give them a value as their health
- [ ] constantly print to the console showing the characters fighting each other in turn until one of their health points drop to 0
- [ ] declare a victor

very similar to [this project from lane from boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/b34b0f83-0af0-4bad-9e8d-65ebcd8d7cbc)

to run:
1. compile the source code into an executable
```sh
make
```

2. run the fight simulator
```sh
./fight_sim
```

3. (optional) remove the executable
```sh
make clean
```
